<p> Kyle Jones - Spring 2018 </p>
	<p>I am Kyle Jones, a freshman student at Wright State University. I 
	am studying Computer Science and expect to graduate Fall 2021. my intended
	field within computer science is still unknown, although I am exploring web
	development and AI. I currently live at the Honors dorm, but plan to move to
	an apartment next year.</p>
	<p>I went to Milford High School. Although not as popular a choice as UC, a decent number
	of kids from Milford go to Wright State. Additionally, before college, I had lived 
	and gone to school in Milford my entire life.</p>
	<p>My dad showed me technical things like taking apart computers when I was young, 
	and this got me interested in engineering. After taking a introduction to 
	engineering course in 7th grade, I knew that I would be doing something related
	to engineering for my career. During high school I took 6 other engineering classes
	and found out that Computer Science was the best field for me.</p>
